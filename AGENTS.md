# Ableton Extensions SDK - Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
R&D monorepo for building Ableton Live extensions using the (alpha) Extensions SDK.
The SDK itself lives in `extensions-sdk/` as a vendored dependency. Our extensions go in `extensions/`.
`ableton-midi-sculptor/` contains an older Max for Live project being ported to an extension.

## Extension Development

### Current API version: 0.0.5
The SDK is at version 0.1.0-beta. Always use `initialize(context, "0.0.5")` and
`"minimumApiVersion": "0.0.5"` in manifest.json.

### Creating a new extension
Each extension needs at minimum:
- `manifest.json` with `name`, `author`, `version`, `entry`, `minimumApiVersion`
- `package.json` with `"@ableton/extensions-sdk": "file:../../extensions-sdk"` as a dependency
- An entry point (TypeScript recommended, must be bundled to CJS for the runtime)

See `extensions/mutate/` for a minimal reference (single-phase esbuild, stub modal dialog) or `extensions/notation/` for a full-featured reference (Preact UI, vitest tests).

### Key patterns
- The extension entry point must export an `activate` function
- Initialize the API with: `const context = initialize(activation, "0.0.5")`
- The Extension Host runs CommonJS only — always bundle with esbuild to CJS
- Extensions are distributed as ZIP files containing `manifest.json` + the compiled entry point
- HTML files for webview dialogs are imported as text and passed as data URLs

### Context menu scopes
Valid scopes for `context.ui.registerContextMenuAction()`:
- `AudioTrack`, `MidiTrack` — right-click track header
- `AudioClip`, `MidiClip` — right-click a clip
- `ClipSlot` — right-click a clip slot
- `Scene` — right-click a scene
- `AudioTrack.ArrangementSelection`, `MidiTrack.ArrangementSelection` — right-click a time selection
- `ClipSlotSelection` — right-click with multiple clip slots selected in Session View

### Building
- Use esbuild to bundle to CJS (see `extensions/mutate/esbuild.js` for a minimal single-phase config, or `extensions/notation/esbuild.js` for a two-phase UI-bundling config)
- Use `.html` loader in esbuild to inline webview HTML as text
- Distributed extensions (ZIP) should not include `node_modules/` or `package-lock.json`

### Testing
- Tests use vitest with `@ableton/extensions-sdk/testing` for mocking
- Run with `vitest run` or `npm test`

### Running in Developer Mode
1. Open Live > Settings > Extensions > click DeveloperMode
2. Run `npm run dev` (or `npm run dev -- path/to/extension`)
3. The dev script auto-finds the Ableton Extension Host and connects to Live
4. Ctrl+C and re-run to pick up code changes (no need to restart Live)

## Tech Stack
- Node.js 25+ (native TypeScript support, no flags needed)
- TypeScript for all new code
- ESM modules (`"type": "module"` in root package.json)

## SDK Documentation
- HTML docs are in `extensions-sdk/docs/`
- Type declarations in `extensions-sdk/dist/` (check `index.d.cts` and `Application-*.d.cts`)
- Run `npm run build:kb` to flatten docs + examples + types into `knowledge-base/` for Claude Projects
- Key doc sections: getting-started, essentials (basics, concepts, interface), development

## Active Focus: Notation Extension

The current focus is `extensions/notation/` — an extension that renders MIDI clips as
sheet music notation. Right-click → "Notation: Render …" opens a modal dialog;
multi-clip entry points render each clip on its own staff in a score layout.

### Architecture
- `src/extension.ts` — reads clip notes + song metadata, opens dialog in a loop
  (export actions write a temp file, open it with system `open` command, then re-show the dialog).
  Registers six context menu actions:
  - `MidiClip` → "Render Clip" (single clip, Session or Arrangement)
  - `ClipSlotSelection` → "Render Selection" (Session, one or more slots)
  - `Scene` → "Render Scene" (all MIDI clips in a scene's row)
  - `MidiTrack.ArrangementSelection` → "Render Selection" (Arrangement time range;
    MIDI clips overlapping the range via `track.arrangementClips`)
  - `MidiTrack` → "Render Track (Session)" (all clipSlots flattened onto one staff;
    empty slots become bar rests, trailing empties trimmed)
  - `MidiTrack` → "Render Track (Arrangement)" (all arrangementClips flattened onto
    one staff aligned to the arrangement bar grid; gaps become rest measures).
    Session vs arrangement is exposed as two menu items because the SDK currently
    provides no way to detect which view the user right-clicked from.
- `src/ui/app.tsx` — Preact UI with toolbar (quantize, time sig, view toggle, export)
- `src/ui/musicxml.ts` — converts quantized MIDI notes to MusicXML
- `src/ui/quantize.ts` — snaps notes to grid (16th, mixed 16th/triplet, 32nd)
- `src/ui/bridge.ts` — webview ↔ extension host communication via `close_and_send`
- `src/ui/template.html` — HTML shell with CSS; JS is bundled and injected by esbuild

### Pipeline: MIDI notes → quantize → MusicXML → OSMD renders SVG
- Multi-clip: each clip becomes a separate `<part>` in MusicXML with its own staff and clef
- Uses 24 divisions per quarter note (LCM of 8 and 6) to support both 32nds and triplets
- Triplet notes need `<time-modification>` and `<tuplet>` bracket notation in MusicXML
- Key signature derived from `song.rootNote` + `song.scaleName`
- Time signature from first scene (defaults to 4/4 if scene returns -1)
- Clef auto-detected from average pitch (bass clef below middle C)

### Known limitations
- Webview (WKWebView/WebView2) does not support `download` attribute or `navigator.clipboard` —
  file export goes through extension host via `close_and_send`, Cmd+C doesn't work
- SDK properties may return BigInt — always coerce with `Number()` / `String()` before serializing
- Dialog communication is one-way: data injected before show, single JSON result on close
- The alpha SDK reports `clip.endMarker` at the absolute clip end rather than the
  playback end, so renderers use `clip.loopEnd` as the effective end regardless of
  whether the clip is looping.

### Clip render region
The shared helper `getClipRenderRegion(clip, beatsPerMeasure)` in [src/ui/musicxml.ts](extensions/notation/src/ui/musicxml.ts)
is the single source of truth for how a clip's playback region maps onto the
notated staff. It returns `{ filterStart, renderEnd, renderStart, barCount }`:
- `filterStart` — `min(loopStart, startMarker)` if looping (the loop region plays
  even when it precedes startMarker), else `startMarker`. Notes before this time
  are dropped.
- `renderEnd` — always `clip.loopEnd` (see the alpha-SDK endMarker caveat above).
- `renderStart` — `floor(filterStart / beatsPerMeasure) * beatsPerMeasure`; the
  first notated bar rounds back to the previous barline so the staff grid aligns
  to the song, with any sub-bar offset rendered as leading rests.
- `barCount` — `max(1, ceil((renderEnd - renderStart) / beatsPerMeasure))`; the
  number of notated measures the clip occupies, rounded up so partial-bar clips
  leave trailing rests.

The "Render Track" handlers reuse this helper to compute per-clip bar spans
when flattening a track's clips into a single staff.

### Development workflow
Always rebuild after making changes: `cd extensions/notation && npm run build`
Test in Live with: `npm run dev -- extensions/notation` (from repo root)
Before finishing a task, `npm run check` (typecheck + vitest) must pass.

### Tracking
Issues are tracked in Linear under the "MIDI Notation Extension" project (AJM-xxx).

## Rules
- Do not modify anything inside `extensions-sdk/` — it is a vendored dependency
- Keep each extension self-contained with its own package.json and build
- Use `file:../../extensions-sdk` (adjust depth as needed) for the SDK dependency path
